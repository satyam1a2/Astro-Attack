In Astro Attack, you control a spacecraft positioned at the bottom of the screen. Your mission is to defend the galaxy from waves of invading aliens. The aliens move left to right and gradually descend towards your spacecraft.

You must shoot the aliens before they reach your spacecraft. Once all aliens in a wave are destroyed, a new wave of aliens appears, and the battle continues.

Be vigilant and quick, as any alien that touches your spacecraft will cause you to lose the game.

How long can you survive the relentless alien onslaught? Test your skills and aim for the highest score in Astro Attack!
